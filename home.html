    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Chairman's Note</h2>
    <h3>Mr. Lateef Khan</h3>
    <p>
        EdVenture Park was initiated to create a community of like minded young and enterprising people, who would come together to solve problems for the society, give their ideas a shape, and add value. The results from the first cohort are not just encouraging, but also inspiring in many ways. With 50% of our population under 25, India needs many more EdVenture Parks and we are always happy and willing to contribute and collaborate with the Government and other partners to build this strong ecosystem.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>CEO's Note</h2>
    <h3>Mr. Meraj Faheem</h3>
    <p>
        "Edventure park is that opportunity, which I wish had existed when I was in college. With the kind of human resources India boasts of, it’s not just important, but critical at this juncture to focus on the youth of our country to empower and support them to become strong, independent and “world worthy individuals”, who’d make us and India proud. EdVenture Park’s first cohort proves the fact that with little bit of focus and intent, we can achieve wonders."
